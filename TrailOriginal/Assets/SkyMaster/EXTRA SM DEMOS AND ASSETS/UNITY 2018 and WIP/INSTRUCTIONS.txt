This folder contains two extra packages, one for Unity 2018 compatibility and one for 
the upcoming v4.0 WIP Betas.

The Unity 2018 folder has the new version of Sky Master for Unity 2018 (Exported with Beta 13).
This version can also be used as standalone, so it can be imported alone and used directly in
a project (to avoid having to use the demo assets and use the minimal disk space).

Also this version contains a prefab made for direct use in Linear Color space.

The "VOLUME CLOUDS v4.0 and SEGI" folder contains a Unity 5.6 exported Unity package with the
early Beta WIP for the new v4.0 clouds system and an optimized version of SEGI. It also
adds a few demo scenes for reference. 

The system is not yet documented, and a video with instructions will follow soon. 
The InfiniCLOUD script may be used to do the base cloud setup, attach to the main camera and press the buttons in 
succesion to activate the base and various extra systems.

Make sure to add the "Background" layer to Unity layers at editor time, if the Blend with background
option is used (it is setup using the "Setup Back Layer" Button, set the layer before pressing the
button to avoid errors). Also make sure to add the "TerrainSM" layer first, in order to avoid
demo mountains move to Background layer (since TerrainSM is the first defined user layer when the
unitypackage is exported).

Also disable the "Clouds (108) DOME SHADOWS" for getting only the new v4.0 shadows.

The SEGI version uses a new optimization variable (top one in the script), which defaults to 1 (no optimization), 
and can be set to make the update rate every 2-3 seconds, which can give a big boost to performance.
